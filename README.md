# Tic Tac Toe 

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using React. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to try and achieve a winning combination. The project is styled using CSS and includes features such as resetting the game, undoing moves, and displaying the winner or a draw.

## Features
- Play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe with a friend.
- Visual indicators for filled cells and the winning combination.
- Reset the game to its initial state.
  Undo moves and go back to the previous state.
- Informative messages indicating the current player's turn, winner, or a draw.

## How to Play
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking an empty cell with their respective symbols ("X" or "O").
